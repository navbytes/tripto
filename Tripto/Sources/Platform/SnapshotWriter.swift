/// `TriptoApp`'s `scenePhase -> .background`, and
/// `SyncEngine.wipeForSignOut()` (-> `clear()`).
///
/// An `actor` for the same reason `SyncEngine` is one: the debounce task
/// and the eventual `SyncStore` read both need one serialized owner, and
/// nothing here needs to be `@MainActor` — no view reads this type
